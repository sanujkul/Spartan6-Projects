# Spartan6-Projects

This repository contains projects for Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA written in VHDL.  

They are based on the concepts and techniques learned in following courses :  
1. ECD14 : Digital System Design using VHDL/Verilog by Abhay Sharma
2. ECD09 : Computer Architecture and Digital Hardware Design by Prof. D.V. Gadre. 

Board used is MINI_SP6-SPARTAN 6 FPGA DEVELOPMENT BOARD bought from  
FPGA Tech Solutions, https://fpgatechsolution.com/product/mini-sp6/

## Projects Description 

### 1. Single-Dice-Game. 
This is a simple game based on luck. Player chooses a 3 bit number from 1 to 7 on the DIP Switches 2,3,4 and presses the button. If the random number generated by LFSR Random Number generator (displayed on LD5,LD6,LD7) matches the number that user selected then a green light will indicate a win, otherwise blue light will indicate player has lost the game.

### 2. UART
This project implement a UART TX and RX Component working at 9600 baud rate, 8N1. These RX and TX componets are instantiated in the main file
and used is following way:  
1. The data that FPGA receives on RX_Line is displayed on the 8 USER LEDS.
[Video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBL-hSgXtCE).   
2. To transmit, USER selects 7 bit number from using SW1 DIP switch and K4, K3, K2 Push buttons. Then to transmit the data over TX_line, user presses K1 Push Button.

##### Feature: The UART RX and TX line can receive and trasmit data simultaneously.   
Following images show reveiving of data 'E' (i.e. 0x45 or 0b01000101) over UART and displaying it on 8 USER LEDs and transmitting 'A', 'B', 'C' ... character from FPGA.

### 3. PWM  
This project generates a PWM signal.  
Working: At every positive clock edge, counter counts increases form 0 to 99 and resets to 0 at 100. User can select duticycle using DIP Switches and Push Buttons available on development board. The PWM_out pin remains HIGH for the count in range [0,duticycle) and LOW for count in range [duticycle, 100) and therefore we can achieve 0% to 100% duticycle by this method.  
##### Folowing images shows controlling LED brightness with various duticycles:   
0%, 1% and 16% duticycles respectively.

and 32%, 64% and 100% duticycles respectively:

### 4. MIPS-ALU-32bits  
Designing and simulation of a 32 bit MIPS-ALU. This ALU has functions of all basic ALUs with addition to MIPs features.
These are AND, OR, SUM, SUBTRACT, SLT (Set Less Than), NOR and Zero flag.

Concept of this ALU is based on book Computer Architecture and Design by Patterson and Hennessy.  
32 bit MIPs ALU uses 32 1 bit MIPS ALU.  
Instead of using standard library function on 32 bit operators for above mentioned functions (that book showed in an example), here in this project, first 1 bit ALU is created using simple AND gate, NOT gate, OR gate, Full adder, Multiplexer and then this will be used to create 32 bit ALU.

(At present, work is committed till completion of 1 bit MIPS ALU)
